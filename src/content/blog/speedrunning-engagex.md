Speedrunning isn't just for video games. Sometimes you need to build something fast - really fast. Here's how I built EngageX in record time.

## What is EngageX?

EngageX was a project that needed to be done quickly. The goal: build a functional, useful application in the shortest time possible without sacrificing too much quality.

## The Strategy

### 1. Ruthless Prioritization

Not every feature is essential. I made a list:
- **Must have** - Core functionality only
- **Nice to have** - Can add later
- **Never** - Out of scope

I only built the "must have" features. Everything else could wait.

### 2. Use What You Know

No time for learning new frameworks. I stuck with:
- Technologies I already knew
- Patterns I'd used before
- Libraries I was familiar with

Learning happens on personal time, not during speedruns.

### 3. Copy, Don't Create

Why write code when you can:
- Use existing libraries
- Copy patterns from other projects
- Leverage templates and starters
- Reference documentation examples

Originality is overrated when speed matters.

### 4. Skip the Nice-to-Haves

I skipped:
- Comprehensive error handling (basic only)
- Extensive testing (manual testing only)
- Beautiful UI (functional is fine)
- Documentation (code comments only)
- Optimization (make it work first)

These can all be added later if the project succeeds.

### 5. Time Boxing

I set strict time limits:
- Day 1: Core architecture
- Day 2: Main features
- Day 3: Polish and deploy

No feature creep. No "just one more thing."

## What I Learned

**Speed forces focus** - When time is limited, you make better decisions about what actually matters.

**Good enough is good enough** - Perfect is the enemy of done. Ship something that works.

**Iteration beats planning** - Building teaches you more than planning ever will.

**Constraints are liberating** - Having less time means less second-guessing.

## The Result

EngageX shipped on time. It wasn't perfect, but it worked. And that's what mattered.

## Would I Do It Again?

Absolutely. Speedrunning teaches you:
- What you can actually build in a day
- What features you can live without
- How to make hard decisions quickly
- That shipping beats perfection

Sometimes the best way to learn is to go fast and see what breaks. Then fix it. Or don't. Either way, you've learned something.
