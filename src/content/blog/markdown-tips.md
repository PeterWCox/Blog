Markdown is a lightweight markup language that's perfect for writing blog posts, documentation, and notes. Here are some tips to make the most of it.

## Headers

Use `#` for headers. More `#` means smaller headers:

```markdown
# H1 - Main Title
## H2 - Section
### H3 - Subsection
#### H4 - Even Smaller
```

## Emphasis

- **Bold** with `**text**` or `__text__`
- *Italic* with `*text*` or `_text_`
- ***Bold and italic*** with `***text***`
- ~~Strikethrough~~ with `~~text~~`

## Lists

### Unordered Lists

```markdown
- Item one
- Item two
  - Nested item
  - Another nested item
- Item three
```

### Ordered Lists

```markdown
1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item
```

## Code

Inline code with backticks: `const x = 10;`

Code blocks with triple backticks:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  return `Hello, ${name}!`;
}
```

## Links and Images

- Links: `[text](https://example.com)`
- Images: `![alt text](image-url.jpg)`

## Blockquotes

> This is a blockquote. Use `>` at the start of the line.
> 
> You can have multiple paragraphs in a blockquote.

## Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | More     |
| Row 2    | Data     | More     |

## Horizontal Rules

Use three dashes, asterisks, or underscores:
