Chiang Mai has been a digital nomad hotspot for years. After spending time there, here's my honest take on what it's really like.

## The Good

### Cost of Living

Chiang Mai is cheap. Really cheap.
- Accommodation: $200-500/month for a decent place
- Food: $2-5 for excellent local meals
- Coffee: $1-2 for good coffee
- Coworking: $50-100/month

You can live comfortably on $1000/month. That's hard to beat.

### Food Scene

The food is incredible. From street food to upscale restaurants, Chiang Mai has it all:
- Khao Soi (curry noodle soup) - a must-try
- Street food markets every night
- International options if you need a break
- Fresh fruit everywhere

### Community

The digital nomad community is large and welcoming:
- Regular meetups and events
- Coworking spaces full of remote workers
- Easy to make friends
- Supportive community

### Nature and Culture

Chiang Mai isn't just about working:
- Temples everywhere
- Mountains nearby for hiking
- Elephant sanctuaries (ethical ones)
- Night markets
- Old city charm

## The Bad

### Air Quality

The burning season (February-April) is brutal. The air quality index can hit 200+ (unhealthy). If you have respiratory issues, avoid these months.

### Internet Reliability

While many places have good WiFi, it's not guaranteed:
- Power outages happen
- Internet can be slow during peak hours
- Some areas have spotty coverage
- Always have a backup (mobile hotspot)

### Tourist Traps

The old city is beautiful but touristy:
- Overpriced restaurants
- Touts everywhere
- Crowded during high season
- Less authentic experiences

### Visa Situation

Tourist visas are limited:
- 30 days visa-free (for many countries)
- Can extend once for 30 more days
- After that, you need to leave or get a proper visa
- Visa runs are common but getting stricter

## The Reality

### Working There

Coworking spaces are good but not great:
- Punspace and CAMP are popular
- WiFi is usually reliable
- Air conditioning is essential
- Can get crowded during peak hours

Cafes are hit or miss:
- Some have great WiFi and power outlets
- Others are too loud or don't allow long stays
- Coffee quality varies wildly

### Living There

Chiang Mai is a city, not a resort:
- Traffic can be bad
- Pollution (outside burning season) is still an issue
- Infrastructure is developing but not perfect
- Language barrier exists (though many speak English)

### Is It Worth It?

**Yes, if:**
- You want to save money
- You're okay with some inconveniences
- You value community and networking
- You want to experience Thai culture

**No, if:**
- You need perfect internet reliability
- Air quality is a concern
- You want a resort-like experience
- You need Western amenities

## My Verdict

Chiang Mai is a great place to work remotely, but it's not perfect. The low cost and strong community make it attractive, but you trade some comforts for those benefits.

I'd go back, but I'd avoid burning season and have backup internet plans. It's a solid choice for digital nomads, but manage your expectations.

The hype is real, but so are the challenges.
